More Info
=========

This app was created over the course of about 8-10 hours in a weekend [WillowTree Apps](http://www.willowtreeapps.com) hackathon.  It allows the user to track their sets, save progress while building, and track which sets they've completed.  It also features Google+ sign-in for achievements.  Nothing too special or crazy, but it was a fun project to churn out in a relatively small amount of time.
